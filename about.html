<div class="info">
<p> For years I have worked with separate operating systems, MAC, Windows and briefly explored Linux RedHat utilising VMware, I have been greatly appreciative to have been given the opportunity to learn of the differences each one has to offer.<br>

I am currently enrolled at Algonquin College pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming to expand my knowledge in this industry further. Throughout the course of my program, I have studied the essentials of programming, Java language and MySQL database. I have also acquired knowledge through self-directed learning with Bootstrap framework, programming languages such as, Html5, Css3 and, JavaScript. In addition to this Iâ€™ve familiarized myself with design fundamentals through UI/UX design, Blender Animation and video game creation using Unity Technologies and Unreal Engine.</p>
